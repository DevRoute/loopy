# Frontend Performance Metrics--FMP

FMP (First Meaningful Paint) is an important metric in Web performance optimization, used to measure the time when users see the "first meaningful content" during page loading. Specifically, it represents the first moment users see content in the browser—when both visibility and interactivity of the page change.

As a key metric for measuring page loading speed, FMP focuses on content rendering in the page's visible area, rather than just page load completion. FMP attempts to measure the earliest moment when users can start seeing and interacting with content, not when the page is completely loaded (e.g., when the load event fires).

In other words, FMP lets you know when users can start actually perceiving and using the page during the loading process, which is crucial for optimizing user experience and interactivity.

First, let's look at the following image:

We can see that the more "useful" content on a page typically has rich information, such as images, videos, animations, and elements that occupy large visible areas. There are two types of content that can be considered "useful": single block elements and large elements composed of multiple elements. For example, video elements and banner images are single block elements, while image lists and multi-image combinations are element combinations.

Discussing FMP is essentially answering the question "is it useful?" The industry often considers FMP time as the first screen time. Although they're not exactly equal in absolute accuracy, both can precisely reflect the current page's loading and rendering performance. FMP is typically considered the moment when users obtain the main information of the page, meaning user needs are satisfied, which is why product teams often focus on the FMP metric.

To summarize, the conditions for becoming an FMP element are:

- Large volume ratio
- High visible screen ratio
- Higher proportion of resource loading elements (img, svg, video, object, embed, canvas)
- Main elements may be composed of multiple components

## How to Set Up the Algorithm

After introducing the concept of FMP and its conditions, let's look at how to design the algorithm for obtaining FMP. Based on the above introduction, we know the algorithm is divided into two parts:

- Getting FMP elements
- Calculating FMP elements' loading time

The specific algorithm flow is shown in the following diagram:

![](https://ik.imagekit.io/moment/md-images/remote/image-1740933138214_nisltG92g.png)

Complete code is shown below:

```ts
interface FMPScore {
  score: number;
  elements: HTMLElement[];
}

class FMPTiming {
  private observer: MutationObserver | null = null;
  private startTime: number;
  private entries: { time: number; score: number }[] = [];
  private stopped = false;
  private timer: number | null = null;

  // Weight configuration
  private static readonly WEIGHT_MAP = {
    IMG: 2,
    SVG: 2,
    CANVAS: 4,
    VIDEO: 4,
    OBJECT: 4,
    EMBED: 4,
    // Weight for other elements is 1
  } as const;

  // Tags to ignore
  private static readonly IGNORE_TAGS = new Set([
    "SCRIPT",
    "STYLE",
    "META",
    "HEAD",
    "LINK",
    "NOSCRIPT",
  ]);

  constructor() {
    this.startTime = performance.now();
    this.init();
  }

  public getFMP(): Promise<number> {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      this.onFMP = resolve;
    });
  }

  private onFMP: ((time: number) => void) | null = null;

  private init(): void {
    // Initial calculation
    this.calculateScore();

    // Observe DOM changes
    this.observer = new MutationObserver(this.handleMutations);
    this.observer.observe(document, {
      childList: true,
      subtree: true,
      attributes: true,
      characterData: true,
    });

    // Set timeout check
    this.timer = window.setTimeout(
      () => this.stop(),
      10000
    ) as unknown as number;

    // Listen for page load completion
    if (document.readyState === "complete") {
      this.checkFMP();
    } else {
      window.addEventListener("load", () => this.checkFMP());
    }
  }

  private handleMutations = (): void => {
    if (this.stopped) return;
    this.calculateScore();
  };

  private calculateScore(): void {
    const score = this.getPageScore();
    const time = performance.now() - this.startTime;

    this.entries.push({ time, score: score.score });

    // Check if this might be the FMP moment when score increases significantly
    this.checkFMP();
  }

  private getPageScore(): FMPScore {
    const elements: HTMLElement[] = [];
    let totalScore = 0;

    const walk = (node: HTMLElement) => {
      if (node.nodeType !== Node.ELEMENT_NODE) return 0;

      const tagName = node.tagName.toUpperCase();
      if (FMPTiming.IGNORE_TAGS.has(tagName)) return 0;

      // Calculate element score
      const rect = node.getBoundingClientRect();
      if (rect.width === 0 || rect.height === 0) return 0;

      // Check if element is in viewport
      const viewportWidth = window.innerWidth;
      const viewportHeight = window.innerHeight;

      if (
        rect.bottom < 0 ||
        rect.right < 0 ||
        rect.top > viewportHeight ||
        rect.left > viewportWidth
      ) {
        return 0;
      }

      // Calculate weight
      const weight =
        FMPTiming.WEIGHT_MAP[tagName as keyof typeof FMPTiming.WEIGHT_MAP] || 1;

      // Calculate element score
      const score = rect.width * rect.height * weight;

      // Check background image
      const style = window.getComputedStyle(node);
      const hasBgImage =
        style.backgroundImage && style.backgroundImage !== "none";
      const finalScore = hasBgImage ? score * 2 : score;

      elements.push(node);
      totalScore += finalScore;

      // Recursively calculate child elements
      for (const child of Array.from(node.children)) {
        totalScore += walk(child as HTMLElement);
      }

      return totalScore;
    };

    walk(document.body);

    return { score: totalScore, elements };
  }

  private checkFMP(): void {
    if (this.stopped || this.entries.length < 2) return;

    const entries = this.entries;
    let maxIncrease = 0;
    let fmpTime = 0;

    // Find point of maximum score increase
    for (let i = 1; i < entries.length; i++) {
      const increase = entries[i].score - entries[i - 1].score;

      if (increase > maxIncrease) {
        maxIncrease = increase;
        fmpTime = entries[i].time;
      }
    }

    // Stop detection if significant change found or page load complete
    if (
      maxIncrease > 0 &&
      (document.readyState === "complete" ||
        maxIncrease > entries[0].score * 0.5)
    ) {
      this.stop();

      if (this.onFMP) {
        this.onFMP(Math.round(fmpTime));
      }
    }
  }

  private stop(): void {
    if (this.stopped) return;
    this.stopped = true;

    if (this.observer) {
      this.observer.disconnect();
      this.observer = null;
    }

    if (this.timer !== null) {
      clearTimeout(this.timer);
      this.timer = null;
    }
  }
}

export default FMPTiming;
```

Usage in React:

```jsx
const measurePerformance = async () => {
  try {
    const fmpTime = await measureFMP();
    console.log("First Meaningful Paint:", fmpTime, "ms");

    // You can send FMP data to your analytics service
    // await sendToAnalytics({ fmp: fmpTime });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to measure FMP:", error);
  }
};

useEffect(() => {
  measurePerformance();
}, []);
```

Let's analyze the code in detail:

1. Constructor

In the constructor, startTime is used to record the start time by calling performance.now() to get the page load start time. The init() method initializes the detector, starting DOM change observation, timeout handling, and page load monitoring.

```ts
constructor() {
  this.startTime = performance.now();
  this.init();
}
```

2. Initialization init method

```ts
private init(): void {
  this.calculateScore();
  this.observer = new MutationObserver(this.handleMutations);
  this.observer.observe(document, {
    childList: true,
    subtree: true,
    attributes: true,
    characterData: true,
  });

  this.timer = window.setTimeout(() => this.stop(), 10000) as unknown as number;

  if (document.readyState === 'complete') {
    this.checkFMP();
  } else {
    window.addEventListener('load', () => this.checkFMP());
  }
}

```

`calculateScore()` is used to calculate the current page's score; `MutationObserver` monitors DOM tree changes, and when new elements are added, deleted, or attributes change, it triggers `handleMutations` callback to recalculate score and check FMP. Through `setTimeout` setting timeout mechanism, it waits up to 10 seconds, and if it times out, it stops detection. And `window.addEventListener('load', ...)` listens for page load completion events to ensure that `checkFMP()` method is called after page load completion to check if FMP has been reached.

3. Detection FMP callback checkFMP

```ts
private checkFMP(): void {
  if (this.stopped || this.entries.length < 2) return;

  const entries = this.entries;
  let maxIncrease = 0;
  let fmpTime = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i < entries.length; i++) {
    const increase = entries[i].score - entries[i - 1].score;

    if (increase > maxIncrease) {
      maxIncrease = increase;
      fmpTime = entries[i].time;
    }
  }

  if (
    maxIncrease > 0 &&
    (document.readyState === 'complete' || maxIncrease > entries[0].score * 0.5)
  ) {
    this.stop();

    if (this.onFMP) {
      this.onFMP(Math.round(fmpTime));
    }
  }
}
```

`checkFMP()` analyzes the score of each time point to find the time point with the most significant score increase, which is considered the potential FMP moment. First, it checks if `this.entries` has at least 2 score records. Then, it calculates the score change between each two time points to find the maximum change point as the potential FMP moment. If a significant score change is found and the page load is complete or the score change exceeds 50%, it stops detection and triggers `onFMP` callback to return FMP moment.

4. DOM change processing handleMutations

```ts
private handleMutations = (): void => {
  if (this.stopped) return;
  this.calculateScore();
};
```

Each time DOM tree changes (e.g., new element added), it calls `handleMutations` method. This method further calls `calculateScore()` to recalculate page score.

5. Score calculation calculateScore

```ts
private calculateScore(): void {
  const score = this.getPageScore();
  const time = performance.now() - this.startTime;

  this.entries.push({ time, score: score.score });

  this.checkFMP();
}
```

`calculateScore` calls `getPageScore()` to calculate the current page's score, records the timestamp, and stores the score and timestamp into `entries` array. After calculating the score, it calls `checkFMP()` method to check if FMP has been reached.

6. Page score calculation getPageScore

```ts
private getPageScore(): FMPScore {
  const elements: HTMLElement[] = [];
  let totalScore = 0;

  const walk = (node: HTMLElement) => {
    if (node.nodeType !== Node.ELEMENT_NODE) return 0;

    const tagName = node.tagName.toUpperCase();
    if (FMPTiming.IGNORE_TAGS.has(tagName)) return 0;

    const rect = node.getBoundingClientRect();
    if (rect.width === 0 || rect.height === 0) return 0;

    const viewportWidth = window.innerWidth;
    const viewportHeight = window.innerHeight;

    if (
      rect.bottom < 0 ||
      rect.right < 0 ||
      rect.top > viewportHeight ||
      rect.left > viewportWidth
    ) {
      return 0;
    }

    const weight = FMPTiming.WEIGHT_MAP[tagName as keyof typeof FMPTiming.WEIGHT_MAP] || 1;
    const score = rect.width * rect.height * weight;
    const style = window.getComputedStyle(node);
    const hasBgImage = style.backgroundImage && style.backgroundImage !== 'none';
    const finalScore = hasBgImage ? score * 2 : score;

    elements.push(node);
    totalScore += finalScore;

    for (const child of Array.from(node.children)) {
      totalScore += walk(child as HTMLElement);
    }

    return totalScore;
  };

  walk(document.body);

  return { score: totalScore, elements };
}
```

`getPageScore` method traverses all elements on the page, calculates the score of each element, and weights the score based on whether it contains a background image. When calculating the element score, it first checks if the element is visible and calculates its size; if the size is zero or outside the viewport, it skips the element. According to the element type (e.g., image, video, Canvas, etc.), different weights are used to calculate the score.

## Summary

The main approach is to monitor DOM changes to calculate page element scores and identify the moment of maximum score change to determine FMP. Score calculation is done by traversing visible elements on the page and calculating scores based on element type, size, background images, and other factors. FMP moment is determined by score changes, with the first significant score increase being identified as FMP. The algorithm continuously observes DOM updates, dynamically tracks the page loading process, and uses page content changes to detect FMP, providing an efficient and flexible detection mechanism.
