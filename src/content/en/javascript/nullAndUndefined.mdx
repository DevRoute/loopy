# null and undefined
From the previous article in this series, we learned that `undefined == null` returns true when performing an equality comparison. However, the ES5 specification doesn't seem to clearly explain why this happens, which aroused my intense curiosity. Through this article, we will unveil this mystery.

## What is undefined

undefined is a primitive data type in JavaScript that represents an "undefined" state. It exists as a global property and is used to indicate that a variable hasn't been assigned a value or a function hasn't returned a value.

When a variable is declared without being initialized, its default value is undefined.

```js
let x;
console.log(x); // Output: undefined
```

If a function has no return statement, or the return statement doesn't return any value, then the function's return value is undefined.

```js
function foo() {}
console.log(foo()); // Output: undefined
```

If a function is called without passing the defined parameters, those parameters will have the value undefined.

```js
function bar(a, b) {
  console.log(a); // 10
  console.log(b); // undefined
}

bar(10);
```

In summary, undefined is used to represent a "not yet defined" state, typically occurring when variables are declared, functions don't return values, or parameters aren't passed.

## What is null

null specifically indicates that an object's value hasn't been set, and it's one of JavaScript's primitive data types. In boolean operations, null is considered falsy, meaning it will be converted to false in a boolean context.

```js
console.log(Boolean(null)); // Output: false
```

null is a literal, unlike undefined, it's not a property of the global object. null indicates that a variable isn't pointing to any object, and can be understood as an "object not yet created". Logically, null represents an empty object pointer, which explains why typeof null returns "object". This historical artifact stems from early JavaScript design, where null was treated in memory as a pointer to an empty object.

```js
console.log(typeof null); // Output: "object"
```

When getting DOM elements, if no matching element is found, null is returned. This indicates there's no matching element to operate on.

```js
const element = document.getElementById("nonexistent");
console.log(element); // Output: null
```

The top of the prototype chain is null. This means that JavaScript objects' prototype chain ultimately points to null, indicating the end of the prototype chain.

```js
const obj = {};
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)); // Output: null
```

In summary, null is used to represent an unset object value, indicating an empty object pointer. It's a common JavaScript primitive data type, frequently used to represent "none" or "empty" states.

## Why typeof null Returns "object"

- When using `typeof` to check the types of `undefined` and `null`, see the following code:

```js
console.log(typeof undefined); // undefined
console.log(typeof null); // object
```

The output of `typeof undefined` as `"undefined"` is probably well-known, but why does `typeof null` output `"object"`? Through research, this is known to be a historical bug. There was once an ECMAScript proposal to fix this, but it was rejected as it would break existing code (projects that rely on this bug...).

In JavaScript's first version, values were stored in 32-bit units (equivalent to a machine code) consisting of a small type tag (1-3 bits) and the actual data of the value. The type tag was stored in the lower bits, where:

1. 000: `object`, data is a reference to an object
2. 1: `integer`, data is a 31-bit signed integer
3. 010: `double`, data is a reference to a double-precision float
4. 100: string, data is a string
5. 110: boolean, data is a boolean value

> In the V8 engine, JavaScript hot code is compiled into machine code, which is directly read and executed by the computer's CPU. It runs fastest but is very obscure and difficult to write; machine code is code that computers can directly execute and runs at the highest speed.

undefined and null are special:

1. undefined: is the integer `(-2)^30` (a number beyond the integer range)
2. null: is the machine code `NULL` pointer, or an object type tag plus a reference of 0

Now, back to our question of why `typeof null` returns `"object"`. It should be easier to understand now.

Because the object type tag is `0`, and since `null` represents an `empty pointer` (JavaScript has no concept of pointers), null is represented by all 32 bits being `0`. Therefore, `typeof null` returns `"object"`.

So from the above summary, `null` is essentially `0`, as shown in the following example:

```js
console.log(undefined + 1); // NaN
console.log(null + 1); // 1
```

When `null` is converted to a `number` type, it becomes `0`.
When `undefined` is converted to a `number` type, it becomes `NaN`.

So what other differences are there in usage? Let's continue with code:

```js
function foo(x = 77, y = "moment") {
  console.log(x); // 77
  console.log(y); // null
}

foo(undefined, null);
```

When calling foo(undefined, null):

1. x's value is undefined, so the default value 77 is assigned to x.
2. y's value is null, so y is set to null instead of the default value "moment".

Here's an example of destructuring assignment:

```js
const [x = 1, y = 2] = [undefined, null];
console.log(x); // Output: 1
console.log(y); // Output: null
```

In this example:

1. x's value is undefined, so it takes the default value 1.
2. y's value is null, so it's directly assigned null instead of taking the default value 2.

## Conclusion

`null` and `undefined` have different meanings and uses in JavaScript. `null` represents an empty object pointer, while `undefined` represents an undefined state. `typeof null` returning `"object"` is a historical artifact from JavaScript's early memory management mechanism. `null` converts to `0` when converted to a number, while `undefined` converts to `NaN`. In function parameters, `undefined` triggers default values, while `null` is directly assigned to parameters without triggering default values.
